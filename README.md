# Java Technical Interview Questions
## Java
* What is the JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
* Define code compilation?
Code compilation is the process of running a java code to see if it can be executed
* What is a constuctor?
It is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created. 

* What is the naming convention of variables in java?
This is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers  such as  classes,constants etc.

* What is an annotation and give an example.
Annotation is a form of syntactic metadata that can be added to Java source code.Java annotations can also be embedded in and read from class files generated by the compiler.Example:
An annotation always starts with the symbol @ followed by the annotation name. The symbol @ indicates to the compiler that this is an annotation.

For e.g. @Override
Here @ symbol represents that this is an annotation and the Override is the name of this annotation.

* What is the difference betwee '==' and equals() when comparing Strings?
* What are the 8 primitive types in Java?
byte
short
int
long
char
float
double
boolean

* What is the difference between primitives and wrapper classes and when can we use each?

Wrapper class is used to encapsulate other primitive class in Java. It , as the name suggests, its object wraps the primitive data. For example it's wraps int to Integer and double to Double and so on. The term "wrapper class" in Java refers to the classes that represent the primitive types in Object form.

* Define Encapsulation and outline its benefits.
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java −

Declare the variables of a class as private.

Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

It’s because encapsulation has a number of advantages that increase the reusability, flexibility and maintainability of the code.
Flexibility: It’s more flexible and easy to change the encapsulated code with new requirements. For example, if the requirement for setting the age of a person changes, we can easily update the logic in the setter method setAge().  
Reusability: Encapsulated code can be reused throughout the application or across multiple applications. For example, the Person class can be reused whenever such type of object is required.  
Maintainability: Application ode is encapsulated in separate units (classes, interfaces, methods, setters, getters, etc) so it’s easy to change or update a part of the application without affecting other parts, which reduces the time of maintenance.

* Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.
* Explain the four OOP principles.
a)Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the idea that the attributes of an entity are enclosed in that entity. This gives context to attributes. This also allows the programmer to restrict access to those attributes so that those attributes are modified and/or used only in ways that the programmer intends to use them.
b)Inheritance
Inheritance is the idea that an entity can inherit attributes from another entity. It allows the programmer to create similar entities without needing to redefine similar attributes over and over.
c)Polymorphism
Polymorphism means “having many forms” which honestly doesn’t really help too much as a definition.  I like to call it a way to have the same method, only different. There are two ways to do this:
1.Overloading: The method name stays the same, but the parameters, the return type and the number of parameters can all change.

2.Overriding: This is when a subclass method has the same name, parameters and return type as a method in a superclass but has a different implementation.

d)Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding all but the relevant information about a thing to make things less complex and more efficient for the user. For example, we don’t need to know how a clock works in order to use it to tell time. Abstraction lets you focus on what the thing does instead of how it does it.

* What is the difference between Abstract classes and Interfaces?
An interface can contain only method declarations.
An abstract class can contain both method declarations (abstract methods) and method implementations (concrete methods).


 Abstract Class	 Interface
1	 An abstract class can extend only one class or one abstract class at a time while	 An interface can extend any number of interfaces at a time
2	  An abstract class can extend another concrete (regular) class or abstract class	while An interface can only extend another interface
3	 An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods while An interface can have only abstract methods
4	 In abstract class keyword “abstract” is mandatory to declare a method as an abstract	 In an interface keyword “abstract” is optional to declare a method as an abstract
5	 An abstract class can have protected and public abstract methods	 An interface can have only have public abstract methods
6	 An abstract class can have static, final or static final variable with any access specifier while interface can only have public static final (constant) variable

* Is it possible to implement multiple inheritance in Java?
Java has no multiple inheritance, so a class can not extend multiple classes. Although you can implement multiple interfaces. Also with Java 8 you can have default implementation in interfaces, so which makes this work-around very similar to multiple inheritance. ... But java support multiple inheritance of types.
* What is serialization? How do you implement it?
* What are anonymous classes?
* What does it means to say that a String is immutable?
* What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
* What are the access modifiers you know? What does each one do?
* Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.
* What the difference between local, instance and class variables?
* What is Dependency Injection?
* What does the static word mean in Java? Can a static method be overridden in Java?
* When is a static block run?
* What is reflection?
* How does the try{} catch{} finally{}
* What is garbage collection? How does it work?
* What is memory leak and how does Java handle it?
* What does the keyword synchronized mean?
* Explain Generics in Java
